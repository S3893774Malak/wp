        <h3>Who is the course instructor</h3>
        <p>Trevor</p>

        <h3>Who is your class tutor</h3>
        <p>Srikanth Thudumu</p>

        <h3>Have you any programming or web design experience?</h3>
        <p> No, I do not have any formal web design experience, although I have keen interest to learn it. This course has motivated me to explore more into it throughout this first assignment I have learnt how to use Git bash, WinSCP and the html to structure the web page. </p>

        <h3>Do you see yourself as a programmer, designer, or both?</h3>
        <p>My keen interest is programming but I also enjoy designing thesefore I see myself as the programmer and the designer</p>

        <h3>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</h3>
        <p>I was actively following Microsoft, FoxPro, Adobe, Intel, IBM, and Java through books, magazines, web articles, and official websites for news updates on services and products in the evolving IT industry from childhood to the early 1990s. It was from this childhood passion that an appealing IT interest for a career-related future was born which I followed through informal learning and practices in the past by setting up and managing my own IT business named Instant computing solutions. I achieved moderate experience in different areas of IT from software, hardware, and setting up small networks, etc., and then I have to pursue formal education so after having thorough research online, I found RMIT to be the best in IT courses. from RMIT I.e. bachelor in IT. After checking the different courses I found my interest in web design and development therefore I choose to pursue this course.</p>

        <h3>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</h3>
        <p>I hope after completing this course I will be able to develop a website from scratch because as per course outline we will learn both front end and backend</p>

        <h3>What websites do you use the most?</h3>
        <p> I frequently visit the following websites </p>
		
		<ul>
                <li><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/">CNN news</a></li>
               <li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news"> BBC News </a></li>
               <li><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk">Dailymail</a></li>
       </ul>
	    

        <h3>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</h3>
        <p> My hobbies and interests include gardening, travelling, exploring different cultures and cuisines, enjoying nature and photography. PlayStation gaming. Cricket and badminton are my favorite sports.</p>
